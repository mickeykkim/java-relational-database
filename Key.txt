Adding keys to records was an interesting challenge. At first, I thought that perhaps the Record class should be responsible for its own key. But the requirement that keys be unique to a table suggested that the key values should instead be handled by the Table class. I thought then that perhaps I should create a list of keys, but then how should the keys and the records be linked? Perhaps, instead, I could use a Linked Hash Map, with hash keys being record keys and hash values being records themselves. I could then have the keys be specified by the user, with the Table class handling validation. Unfortunately, hash maps don't extend collections, so the generic functions such as add broke. There were 5 methods that I then had to update: select, add, insert, delete, and update. This required heavy refactoring of the Table, File, and Print classes.
